### Pooled Split-Plot Analysis Across Seasons

This script performs pooled split-plot ANOVA across multiple seasons
using the CANE package.

The model treats seasons as environments, with replications nested
within seasons, and estimates both main-plot and subplot effects.
Additional summaries include season-wise and pooled treatment means.

An alternative model formulation is used to extract pooled means
for the main-plot factor.
