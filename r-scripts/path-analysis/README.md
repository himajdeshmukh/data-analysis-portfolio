# Path Coefficient Analysis

This folder contains R scripts for **path coefficient analysis**
using structural equation modeling (SEM).

The analysis estimates **direct effects of component traits on yield**
using standardized path coefficients and provides graphical
visualization of causal relationships.

This approach is commonly used in crop improvement and
quantitative trait analysis.
